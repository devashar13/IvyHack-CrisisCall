# DontDieBro

![A prototype of our application](https://media.giphy.com/media/XVjNHkuBOt3lYPbOv2/giphy.gif)

## Objective

To provide a faster and more reliable source for accident and natural calamity detection by notifying friends,family and everyone in a radius of 500m about the disaster. We also plan to expand this app to include features to ensure women safety !

## Implementation

Using google location services and their API, we plan to group mobile phones into clusters and if an accident or a calamity is detected, then we plan on sending an emergency alert to the cluster of phones in that area. Not only will these emergency alerts be sent to the mobiles in a 500m radius, but these alerts will also be sent to the friends and family of the affected people. Using a combination of multiple mobile sensors, we plan to detect calamities and broadcast emergency notifications.

## Application

Our app can potentially help save multiple lives and not only detect the accidents, but also have a faster relief response time as everyone in the radius of 500m will get a push notification. Be it car accidents or natural calamities, our app will be able to detect it as soon as the individual is impacted. We believe that as a society, helping each other during a crisis should be instinctive.

## Technologies Used

Flutter, Google cloud platform, Firebase.

## Unique selling point

Using our own algorithms, we plan to detect car accidents, fire emergencies and other life threatening mishaps.
